 * @date October 2014
 * @brief file containing functions to write bytes, halfwords and words to a simulated memory
 *
 * this file is used by the environment and the code disassembler to read from and write to
 * a simulated memory in the MIPS32 processor. The simulated memory comes from a real portion
 * of RAM memory of the HOST PC. 
 *
 * the set of write and read functions are thougt for a sistem that will store the bytes
 * in memory using "big endian". Naturally, this emulator should run in big endian
 * and little endian processors. That is why each each write and read function has a few
 * code lines that convert the incoming data in to big endian, no matter the format of the
 * incoming data (big or little endian).
 *
 * @todo the block of memory should be created with a tag that identifies it, this is yet to be implemented
