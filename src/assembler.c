 * @brief file containing functions meant to assemble the code from an elf script
 *
 * This file has functions called by the main program when it has to assemble an elf script.
 * 
 * for now, it only has two main functions: compile and parseline. The idea is to parse line per line
 * and store the assembler code in memory, but this is not yet implemented. For now, the only thing
 * this assembler does is read a text from an .elf file, remove the commentary and store it in a 
 * string, which is a field of the general structure ptype.
 *
 * there's an extra function called splitscript that is used by compile

/**
*
* @brief this function calls the other functions in this file and in others, to compile an elf script
* for now, this function only reads a file. It's all it can do for the moment. The objetive for the
* first increment was to be able to include a "debug" command in a script and that way check the status
* of the processor after the last instruction befor "debug" was excecuted. But there were some bugs found
* at the last moment with function parseline that made this not possible.
*
* @param *mips A pointer to a ptype structure, created by the main program.
* @return it returns the pointer to the same structure, but modified
* @note ptype type variables that modifies: full_script 
* @todo "debug" and "restart"
