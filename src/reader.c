 * @brief file containing functions used by main to read a new elf script
 *
 * This file has functions called by the main program when it has to read a new elf script. 
 * The reading of a new file, includes also the removal of the commentary.
 *
 * the only parameter taken in this and in every function in all source files is a pointer
 * to a struct data type. It makes it easier to handle information between functions.
